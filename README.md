## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The sitemap will be generated from `pages/sitemap.xml.js`. You can customize the file with additional XML elements or make it a text only file.
